# Rendering-Lab

This is a ray tracer implemented as part of the rendering lab project at the University of Freiburg. The report of the work done can be found <a href="Report/Adil_Rabbani_Lab_Report.pdf">here</a>. The ray tracer was tested on a machine with Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS. In order to run the code, run this command in the root directory:

```
g++ -o output main.cpp
```
and then run the output file as
```
./output
```
This will start rendering a scene `(benchmark_scene_1)` from `demoscenes/demoscenes.h` and the rendered image is saved in Å£he folder `renders`, after the rendering is complete. Note that you need to be able to open `ppm` format images. The image below was converted to `png` to support markdown but the same image is rendered with a `ppm` format and saved in the folder.

There are many other scenes to test in `demoscenes/demoscenes.h`. These scenes are functions named as `scene{number}()` from 1 to 9 and they can be called in `main.cpp` to render them. `scene9` and `scene7` require a bool to be passed as an argument which renders the scene with point lights if `false` and area lights if `true`. 

So in order to render `scene2` for example, you can call this function as `scene2()` in the main method of `main.cpp`. And in order to render `scene7` with point lights, the method can be called as `scene7(false)` in `main.cpp`.

You can render your own scenes by making changes to any of the `demoscenes` or by creating your own. The `demoscenes.h` file again is helpful to get an idea how to create your own scene.

One thing to remember is the arguments passed to scene object. If nothing is passed, the scene renders with ambient, diffuse as well as specular material properties and AABBs are used. The arguments can be passed as:
```
Scene scene()

Scene scene(1, 1, 1, 1) // ambient, diffuse, specular, aabb, in that order

Scene scene(1, 1, 1, 1, color(0, 0, 0)) // this extra argument will change the background color to black or any other color of user's choice

Scene scene(1, 1, 1, 1, texture("textures/stars.ppm")) // this extra argument will change the background to a texture
```
There are some other constants that can be set in the file `constants.h`

There are some example renders in the folder `example renders`. The animated ones were converted to a gif using a photo editor. The ray tracer would only create frames one by one.

The external libraries are saved in the folder `libraries` and some parts taken from [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) in the folder `RTIOW`. `aabb.h` is also placed in `Scratchapixel` as I'm using the same implementation explained there. There are some other places which are quite similar to how they were explained in [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) but it's rather difficult to separate everything as I also did a lot of changes.
